### Analysis
1. There is a moderate correlation between the latitude of a city and its maximum temperature. The data suggests that the farther away a city is from the equator, the lower the maximum temperature will be. It is possible that latitudes closer to the equator experience warmer temperatures due to their increased exposure to sunlight. The correlation in the southern hemisphere is stronger with an r-squared value of 0.54, compared to the one in the north at 0.37.

2. There are very weak, next to zero, correlation for wind speed in the northern and southern hemispheres. The r-squared values for the referenced plot suggests that latitude does not have an effect on wind speed.

3. There are very weak, next to zero, correlation for cloud coverage in the northern and southern hemispheres. The r-squared values for the referenced plot suggests that latitude does not have an effect on cloud coverage.
